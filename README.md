ShortestPath

This class computes the distance of the shortest path between nodes of a simple, undirected, irreflexive graph.
The pupose of this project is to gain experience using multithreading via pthread API as well as OpenCL programming.

Current Status:
Program calculates shortest path with a single thread

To Do:
Scale to use many threads via use of pthreads
Redesign with OpenCL
Optimize by reducing matrix calculations to upper triangular only
