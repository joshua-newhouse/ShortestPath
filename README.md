ShortestPath

This class computes the distance of the shortest path between nodes of a simple, irreflexive graph.
The pupose of this project is to gain experience using multithreading as well as OpenCL programming.

Current Status:
Program calculates shortest path with a single CPU thread

To Do:
Scale to use many CPU threads
Redesign with OpenCL to utilize GPU
Optimize by reducing matrix calculations to upper triangular only
